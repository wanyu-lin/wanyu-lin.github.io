Wanyu is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Wanyu is serving as an Associate Editor for  <a href="https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-neural-networks-and-learning-systems/ieee-transactions-on-neural-networks-and-learning-systems">IEEE Transactions On Neural Networks and Learning Systems</a> (TNNLS) and Associate Editor for  <a href="https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-emerging-topics-in-ci">IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence </a> (TETCI).

Wanyu’s primary research interest is in 1) AI for science. We focus on developing machine learning (ML) techniques (Geometric GNNs, diffusion, etc.) to accelerate scientific simulations and design (applications in materials, drug discovery); 2) creating collaborative AI systems (federated learning/multi-agent systems) with various trustworthy objectives, such as interpretability, privacy and safety.
